"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I'm emailing to confirm that you have a 7 foot 5 Super Fish board, as well as a 5 foot 6 short board available? My wife and I are thinking of stopping by your shop tomorrow and it's a bit of a drive."
"2017/08/28 4:52:59 PM CDT","Hi Customer one,

I am pleased to say we have those two boards available, but we cannot hold them for you. Because of how low our stock is right now, everything is on a first come first serve basis. I'm sorry we cannot guarantee the items for you and your wife.

Feel free to call tomorrow morning before the drive to ask if they are available.

Thanks.  "

I've checked our systems and asked our warehouse staff, but unfortunately we do not have either of those boards available right now. We have other boards in that size range however, if you are open to something else. 

I can notify you when we receive a new shipment, if you'd like. 

We're sorry for causing any inconveniences and I hope you consider our shop again in the future. "

We sold all our stock in long boards this week and don't expect to have anymore in stock for some time, but we have other boards that may fit what you are looking for. We would be happy to walk you through our lineup tomorrow if you come by.

Hope to see you soon! Thank you for checking in. "
