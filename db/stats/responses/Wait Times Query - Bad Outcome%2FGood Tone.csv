"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it. I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that. Thank you for your help!"

Sometimes we can rush jobs, but the Super Fish is a complex and labor intensive design. We are very excited to hear that your friend enjoyed their board and would like to offer you 10% off any future purchases. Good luck and we hope to see you soon! "

I'm happy to hear that your friend is enjoying their new board!

I've checked with our designers and unfortunately we cannot meet the 10 week deadline
for your trip due to high demand. Right now we require around 12 weeks to complete custom
orders.

Are you able to meet next Tuesday for roughly 30 minutes at 1300? We will use
that time to discuss design and show you the overall process.

Let me know your thoughts and we apologize for causing any inconveniences."

Unfortunately,  our waiting list is such that we cannot commit to a delivery in10 weeks.  We could negotiate something in 16 weeks, but not a day sooner.  Try Pete's Surf down the road.

Thank you for coming to us for a board request. Although we would love to accommodate your timeframe I cannot guarantee that it will be ready in time for your trip. I do still recommend that you take your surf game to the next level by ordering a customer board now so you have it on hand for all of your future endeavours. Call me on my personal line anytime and i would love to help you out in any way I can.
