"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it. I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that. Thank you for your help!"

Sometimes we can rush jobs, but the Super Fish is a complex and labor intensive design. We are very excited to hear that your friend enjoyed their board and would like to offer you 10% off any future purchases. Good luck and we hope to see you soon! "

I'm happy to hear that your friend is enjoying their new board!

I've checked with our designers and unfortunately we cannot meet the 10 week deadline
for your trip due to high demand. Right now we require around 12 weeks to complete custom
orders.

Are you able to meet next Tuesday for roughly 30 minutes at 1300? We will use
that time to discuss design and show you the overall process.

Let me know your thoughts and we apologize for causing any inconveniences."
