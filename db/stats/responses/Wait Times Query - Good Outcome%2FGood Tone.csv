"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it. I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that. Thank you for your help!"

We are pleased to inform you that we just had some new slots open and would love to take your deposit and start on your new dream board. If you can please provide us with the $250 deposit fee we may begin on the board immediately. We expect wait times on a new board to range from 6-8 weeks, this should be in line with your 10 week place and we should get you the board with plenty of time to spare. We thank you for the support and patience and look forward to working with you. 
Best regards,
Customer Service One

We are very happy to hear your friend enjoyed his new board!

We will be on a tight schedule to meet the 10 week deadline, but we are confident we can make it happen. 
Are you able to meet next Tuesday at 1300 to discuss design and show you the overall process?  

Let me know if that time works and thank you for contacting us."
"2017/08/28 3:57:50 PM CDT","Hi, thank you for reaching out. I am happy that your friend is pleased with their purchase and referred you to us. It will take about 4-6 weeks to complete the 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and about a week to ship. We are available anytime between 9AM and 5PM Monday through Friday during store hours. We look forward to discussing your design!"
"2017/08/28 7:17:26 PM CDT","Hi, Customer One!

We're thrilled that your friend recommended us and we hope he enjoys his new board for many years to come!

We would be happy to meet with you next week to discuss your design ideas. Would Tuesday at 1300 work? The consultation should take 30 minutes at most. Our designers are excited to get started on your project!

Let us know if another time works better for you or if you need any more information."
"2017/08/31 11:23:19 PM CDT","Hi! Thank you for the great feedback - we love when our products speak for themselves and draw interest from new customers. Next week sounds great, would Wednesday at 0900 work for you? We will definitely be able to get you your board in 10 weeks. Let us know what works for you and we look forward to meeting you. "
"2017/09/02 1:29:24 PM CDT","We are so pleased to hear you loved your friend's board so much. We are very confident you will like your new board just as much. Luckily, I do have an opening next Thursday and we can get our board makers on the task right away! Please let me know if that can work for you. We can wait to meet you!"
