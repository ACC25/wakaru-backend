"Timestamp","Customer: Hi Customer Service One, I can see on your site that it says out of stock for your red and black 6 foot board bags from Excel, but I was wondering if you had any in your warehouse or if you could order one for me? I am going on a road trip in two weeks and would like to have something to protect my board. Thanks!"

We don't have that bag available and our resupply time is more than two weeks, with no express shipping available. So we won't be able to accommodate your request. 

Thanks. "
