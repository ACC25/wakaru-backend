"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I can see on your site that it says out of stock for your red and black 6 foot board bags from Excel, but I was wondering if you had any in your warehouse or if you could order one for me? I am going on a road trip in two weeks and would like to have something to protect my board. Thanks!"

I've checked with our warehouse staff and we do have one left in stock! I've asked them to put it aside for now, depending on how you want to proceed. You can either pick it up at our store or we can ship it (the cost would be the same as if you bought it online). 

Just let me know -- it's yours either way.

Thank you for taking the time to email us."

Our site is correct, we are out of stock, but we would be happy to order you a bag from one of our distributors. There shouldn't be any issue getting it here before you leave on your trip. 

Thank you for reaching out!  "
