"Timestamp","Hi Customer Service One, I can see on your site that it says out of stock for your red and black 6 foot board bags from Excel, but I was wondering if you had any in your warehouse or if you could order one for me? I am going on a road trip in two weeks and would like to have something to protect my board. Thanks!"

I've checked with our warehouse staff and, unfortunately, we do not have that bag available right now. It also takes several weeks for our partners to resupply us, so meeting your two week deadline will not be possible on our end. 

Have you checked our site for alternatives? We have express shipping available if you find something else you like. 

Sorry for causing any inconveniences.  "

I'm sorry to say that we do not have any board bags of that size and colour on hand or in our warehouse.

We have other bags that could fit your boards however, if you protecting them is your main priority. You can see them on our site or come into the shop, where we would be happy to help you pick one out. 

Thank you for checking in with us. "

It seems our site is correct in this case, our inventory for those bags is sold out. Unfortunately we cannot order new product within the timeframe you outline either, but we have other bags that may fit the bill for you - if you are okay with a different colour. We would be happy to show you our stock if you can swing by the shop.

Sorry for the bad news. We appreciate you reaching out. "
