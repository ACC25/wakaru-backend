Great news, we have both of those boards available right now and we've set them aside for you. Let one of our staff know you email us about these boards, they will know where to take you.

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!"

We do indeed have a 7 foot 5 Super Fish available, as well as a 5 foot 6 short board. I've put both of the boards on hold, so you don't need to worry about someone snatching them! 

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. 

Thanks. "
