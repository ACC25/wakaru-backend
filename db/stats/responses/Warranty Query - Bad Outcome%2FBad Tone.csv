Timestamp,Customer: I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789). Thanks!
2017/08/28 2:48:04 PM CDT,"You did not purchase the warranty, so the damage is not covered.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
2017/08/28 3:03:29 PM CDT,"Hi Customer,You don't have warranty so we cannot cover the repair cost. Feel free to bring it by our repair shop (where normal rates apply)."
2017/08/28 7:17:49 PM CDT,"I looked up your receipt number, and found that you in fact did not purchase a warranty. Because we do not grant retroactive warrantees for our products, I would recommend that you visit one of the many repair shops nearby. "
2017/08/29 2:29:51 PM CDT,"Since you have not purchased a warranty, we will not cover the repair cost. Next time, get a warranty so that this won't happen again."
2017/08/31 11:17:55 AM CDT,"CustomerYou didn't purchase a warrantee we cannot cover the cost of the repair -- company policy. "
2017/08/31 11:08:49 PM CDT,I regret to inform you that as you did not opt to purchase warranty we will not cover the damages. Visit the shop during business hours if you would like to pay for repairs. 
2017/09/02 1:53:13 PM CDT,"As clearly indicated in our purchasing policies, customers who opt out of product warranty are not covered in any way for accidental damage. You can bring your board to the shop if you wish to pay in full for repairs. "
2017/09/02 4:13:11 PM CDT,"Your receipt indicates that you did not purchase warranty. As our policy states, we will not cover the costs of repairs to your board. If you have any further questions forward them to customer service. "
2017/09/02 7:14:13 PM CDT,You did not purchase a warranty and have caused damage to your board - it is clearly indicated in our policy that repairs are never covered without a warranty. If you wish to pay full price for repairs you can drop your board off at the shop and we will see what we can do. 
2017/09/03 1:08:50 PM CDT,"Because you did not purchase a warranty, you will not receive free repairs."
2017/09/10 2:27:09 PM CDT,"According to our company guidelines, we cannot cover the repair costs unless the board is covered under a warranty. You did not purchase a warranty, and so we cannot wave the costs."
2017/09/10 2:35:11 PM CDT,"Hey Customer One,Bad news. We cannot cover the cost of the repair -- company policy. We haveplenty of rentals you can choose from while you wait for your board to be repaired though."
2017/09/10 2:36:22 PM CDT,"Hey dude, you did not purchase a warranty with us and our backlog is so great with warranty coverage that we cannot fit in anything more this week.  I know it must suck, but we can't do anything. "
2017/09/10 8:07:18 PM CDT,Give me a minute to verify if you purchased a warranty with your recent board purchase yet I want you to know that we cannot repair your board right away whether you have a warranty or not.  Does a rental work for you?
2017/09/13 12:58:05 AM CDT,"When customers refuse Warranty with new product purchases they forfeit the right to repairs of any sort. You should consider this when making your next purchase. In your case, you will need to submit a repair request, at which point we will get back to you with availability. "
