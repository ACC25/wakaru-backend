Timestamp,Customer: I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789). Thanks!
2017/08/28 2:48:04 PM CDT,"You did not purchase the warranty, so the damage is not covered.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
2017/08/28 3:03:29 PM CDT,"Hi Customer,You don't have warranty so we cannot cover the repair cost. Feel free to bring it by our repair shop (where normal rates apply)."
2017/08/28 7:17:49 PM CDT,"I looked up your receipt number, and found that you in fact did not purchase a warranty. Because we do not grant retroactive warrantees for our products, I would recommend that you visit one of the many repair shops nearby. "
2017/08/29 2:29:51 PM CDT,"Since you have not purchased a warranty, we will not cover the repair cost. Next time, get a warranty so that this won't happen again."
2017/08/31 11:17:55 AM CDT,"CustomerWe are sorry to hear that you damaged your surfboard. Even still, because you didn't purchase a warrantee we cannot cover the cost of the repair."
2017/08/31 11:08:49 PM CDT,I regret to inform you that as you did not opt to purchase warranty will not cover the damages. Please visit the shop during business hours if you would like to pay for repairs. 
2017/09/02 1:53:13 PM CDT,"As clearly indicated in our purchasing policies, customers who opt out of product warranty are not covered in any way for accidental damage. You can bring your board to the shop if you wish to pay in full for repairs. "
2017/09/02 4:13:11 PM CDT,"Your receipt indicates that you did not purchase warranty. As our policy states, we will not cover the costs of repairs to your board. If you have any further questions forward them to customer service. "
2017/09/02 7:14:13 PM CDT,You did not purchase a warranty and have caused damage to your board - it is clearly indicated in our policy that repairs are never covered without a warranty. If you wish to pay full price for repairs you can drop your board off at the shop and we will see what we can do.
