"Timestamp","Customer: I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789). Thanks!"

I'm sorry to hear your board was dented, that is very frustrating.

Unfortunately we cannot cover the cost of the repair, but we can get you into
the repair shop as soon as possible. If you can drop the board off in the next
few days, we can try and get you back on the water for the weekend.

We also have rentals available if you have an immediate need for a board.

Thank you for your patience and understanding."
