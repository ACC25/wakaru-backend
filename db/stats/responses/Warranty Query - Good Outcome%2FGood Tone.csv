Timestamp,Customer: I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789). Thanks!

2017/09/10 2:33:13 PM CDT,"I will check about the warranty first.  Thanks for providing the receipt number.  While I am verifying this, tell me a bit about the damage.  What does severely dented look like?  This will help me to judge what is possible and by when, as you did purchase a warranty.  The warranty has limits, so a bit more info should get us to a more concrete place where I can answer your question about a rush repair.  Ok, so I have heard that the backend is dented pretty badly.  Right?  If this is the only major damage, your repair can be completed this week provided the board is delivered tomorrow morning.  A later drop off may negatively impact Pete's ability to get to your board.  Our doors open at 9:00 a.m.   Can you be here with your board at 9:00?  Great.  I will see you tomorrow a.m. As it is my shift.  Thanks."
2017/09/13 12:54:47 AM CDT,"Good evening Customer,  we would first like to thank you for choosing to use our surf boards - your loyalty means a lot to us.
