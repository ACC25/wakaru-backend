Timestamp,"Hi Customer Service One, I was referred to your shop by a friend who recently purchased a custom board and is very happy with the end product. I am in the market for a new 7 foot 5 inch Super Fish and was wondering what your wait times look like? I am going on a surf trip in 10 weeks that I'd love to have the board for it. I have the time to meet next week, to discuss design, but am very busy after that. Thank you for your help!"
2017/08/28 2:50:43 PM CDT,"Hi Customer, we are currently not taking any new orders. We have a large wait list that is currently in use that you must reach the top of before we will take your deposit and give you a time frame for the board. If you would like to add your name to this list phone our store. We expect a 6-8 week wait before being moved off the wait list. "
2017/08/28 3:12:02 PM CDT,"We can't take any new orders right now. We are swamped :(We might have the time to talk when you are back from your trip, but no promises. Email us then as well and we will let you know. "
2017/08/28 7:10:42 PM CDT,"I regret to inform you that due to the high volume of orders we are taking on at the moment, a custom job is not possible during the time frame you have specified. You need to adjust your requirements if you want a board from us. "
2017/08/31 11:20:10 PM CDT,Thank you for your interest but we can't help you. We simply cannot accommodate your timeframe; 10 weeks is far too short for a Super Fish and we currently have a month long wait time for consultations. Next time you should give us a minimum of 15 weeks. It takes a long time to make quality boards. 
2017/09/02 1:24:39 PM CDT,"As you can see on our website, we do not fill custom orders in less than 15 weeks. Please inquire when you have more time. "
2017/09/02 3:24:11 PM CDT,"There is no way we can build a custom board within 10 days.  Even when we can fast track an order, we need a minimum of 20 days.  Try Suzie's Surf Shop, they don't spend as long on boards. In the future, if your window is a bigger one, do contact us as we make the #1 rated boards on the island."
2017/09/02 6:39:35 PM CDT,I do not have the time to meet with you within your timeframe. Next time plan for at least 15 weeks production time. All of this is clearly explained on our company website. 
2017/09/02 7:11:30 PM CDT,10 weeks won't do. Next time make sure to review our website before contacting customer service. If you have a request that meets our production criteria please book a consultation with a member of our team. 
2017/09/10 3:16:38 PM CDT,"Seriously!  We are the #1 rated surfing shop on the north coast, with a waiting list that extends 6 months. Sorry man, yet this is not working for us."
2017/09/13 1:04:18 AM CDT,"Order requests musts be submitted through our official online registration. If you had done this you would have seen that we demand 15 weeks notice for all custom board. We cannot make your board in the timeframe you have requested.  There is nothing further I can do for you."
