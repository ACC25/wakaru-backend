"Timestamp","Customer: I bought one of your surf boards last week and have unfortunately severely dented it already. Is there any way you can cover the repair cost? I'm not sure if I purchased a warranty or not. I have the receipt handy (transaction #123456789). Thanks!"

It doesn't look like you purchased a warranty plan last week, but we appreciate
how frustrating damaging a board is and we want to offer a complimentary repair.
You can drop the board off at our shop anytime this week and we will get it back
 to you as soon as possible.

Thank you for taking the time to write us."
