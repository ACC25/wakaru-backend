You can either pick it up at our store or we can ship it (the cost would be the same as if you bought it online). Just let me know -- it's yours either way. Thank you for taking the time to email us.", "Hi Customer One, Our site is correct, we are out of stock, but we would be happy to order you a bag from one of our distributors. There shouldn't be any issue getting it here before you leave on your trip. Thank you for reaching out!", "Hi, Customer One! We're thrilled that your friend recommended us and we hope he enjoys his new board for many years to come! We would be happy to meet with you next week to discuss your design ideas. Would Tuesday at 1300 work? The consultation should take 30 minutes at most. Our designers are excited to get started on your project! Let us know if another time works better for you or if you need any more information."]
