Timestamp,"Customer: Hi Customer Service One, I can see on your site that it says out of stock for your red and black 6 foot board bags from Excel, but I was wondering if you had any in your warehouse or if you could order one for me? I am going on a road trip in two weeks and would like to have something to protect my board. Thanks!"
